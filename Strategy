Uexit/MOSdev strategy

Money:

I aim to raise enough money to survey without income for three months. 
In terms of house preperation I should have the back room painted and ready to use as a study, and also the bathroom painted. Current furniture is ok and all cooking utensils etc are liveable. for this to happen I will just need to get paint.

Current overheads are £1039 so I will need a minimum of £3000

Work:

I plan to move into contracting for now. I will need to make minimum £1000 per month to stay solvent but I will aim to make at least £3000. 

My advertised day rate will be £250. This will make my total income £6250 per month if I work full time hours. 
My minimum day rate will be £200. This will make my total monthly income £5000 per month. 

To get new work, I will create myself a new website using the domain name mosdev.online. MOSdev will be my trading name. I'll ask thom to create me some web visuals. 
I will need to compile a list of digital agencies across the northwest, sending each one a covering letter and a link to my c.v. /website.
I will also need to polish up my linked in profile, making my front of house as presentable as possible. 

Another important step will be to attend meetups https://www.meetup.com/ in the northwest to talk to other days and meet potential recruiters. I will need Thom to make me some business cards also.

I will contact mel info@melissawood.co.uk and Sean sean@seanlang.co.uk and let them know I am contracting and to send any extra work my way while I get on my feet.
